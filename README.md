# Pipelist - The all-in-one sales list ðŸš€

This project is the result of a challenge, which consisted in creating a single page application, containing a people's list. Essentially Pipelist is a drag and drop list, where the user can interact through different actions like adding and deleting a person, reordering the list, and editing a person's picture.
The project is connected to Pipedrive's API.

## Run

1. Clone the repository to your computer

2. Add an .env file to your root folder

3. Add your default Pipedrive API key or add my personal key from the "Challenge Delivery" email, in this format:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY = key`

4. Install the dependencies and start with npm

`npm i`
`npm start`

5. Have fun!
