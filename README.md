# Pipelist - The all-in-one sales list 🚀

This project is the result of a challenge, which consisted in creating a single page application, containing a people's list. Essentially Pipelist is a drag and drop list, where the user can interact through different actions like adding and deleting a person, reordering the list, and editing a person's picture.
The project is connected to Pipedrive's API.

## Run

1. Clone the repository to your computer

2. Add an `.env` file to the root folder

3. Add your default Pipedrive API key or add my personal key from the "Challenge Delivery" email, in this format:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY = key`

4. Install the dependencies and start with npm

`npm i`
`npm start`

5. Have fun!
